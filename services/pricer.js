// relisted the series market yet. A fixed 6h cutoff would incorrectly
// re-enable us for marathon games (multiple OT, rain delays, etc.)
// where DK is NOT going to have relisted by then. The safe signal is
// simply "startTime is still in the past = DK has not moved on to the
// next game yet = we should not quote".

/**
 * Detect whether a leg is an "alt spread" on a sport that's currently
 * blocked. The block list comes from config.pricing.blockAltSpreadSports
 * (env BLOCK_ALT_SPREAD_SPORTS, default "baseball_mlb,icehockey_nhl,
 * basketball_nba"). Returns null if not blocked, or a human-readable
 * reason string if it should be declined.
 *
 * Detection rules per sport:
 *
 *   MLB / NHL — primary run/puck line is always ±1.5. Allow any leg
 *   with |line| === 1.5 (intentionally includes the OPPOSITE-symbol
 *   alt: if primary is Team A −1.5, also allow Team A +1.5 — the
 *   heavy-favorite alt where the same fav gets a head-start instead).
 *   Block any other magnitude (±0.5, ±2.5, etc.).
 *
 *   The opposite-symbol alts route through odds-feed's signed-key
 *   altSpreads cache (keyed by signed home-perspective home_point), so
 *   "Team A +1.5 (away)" lands in bucket "−1.5" and "Team A −1.5
 *   (away)" lands in bucket "+1.5" — strictly different buckets, no
 *   collision risk. See odds-feed.js getAltLineFairProb() and
 *   spreadHomePoint() for the routing.
 *
 *   NBA — primary spread varies per game. Allow legs whose line is
 *   within ±config.pricing.nbaAltSpreadMaxDistance points of the
 *   primary (in home-team perspective), AND which have coverage in
 *   our alt-lines cache (i.e., at least one book reported odds for
 *   this exact line). Block legs farther than the threshold OR with
 *   no book coverage (we'd have to derive odds ourselves — operator
 *   doesn't want that). Primary lines (onDemand=false) always pass.
 *
 *   Other blocked sports — fall back to the onDemand=true proxy
 *   (RFQ asked for a line we hadn't pre-registered → block).
 *
 * Why this exists: Apr 25 forensic showed alt-spread legs concentrated
 * in the low-fair-prob "red box" region where realized EV/$ was -6%;
 * one recurring 2-leg MLB template (Rockies +1.5 + Under) drove ~$5.8k
 * of loss alone. Block is sport-list driven so we can re-enable per
 * sport without a code change.

  // POLICY CHANGE 2026-04-22: previously we had a direction classifier
  // that applied ×1.15 for "positive" combos (minus+over, plus+under)
  // and ×0.90 for "negative" combos (minus+under, plus+over). Empirical
  // check against a DK SGP reference (OKC -16.5 + Under 216.5) showed
  // the direction classifier gets the sign WRONG for large-spread NBA
  // blowouts: the "fav + under" case is actually POSITIVELY correlated
  // there (starter rest in 4th quarter → pace slows → under hits), yet
  // our code was shrinking fair by 0.90, pushing offered odds longer
  // and leaking EV to bettors. DK's +228 vs our naive-compound-derived
  // +263 on that parlay was a ~35-cent underpricing in the bettor's
  // favor.
  //
  // New policy: treat ALL spread_total SGPs as positively correlated
  // (always widen fair, always shorten offered). Empirically books
  // almost always charge more on SGPs than naive product, regardless
  // of theoretical sign. Safer default — worst case we're slightly
  // tight on the small minority of truly negatively-correlated pairs
  // and lose those fills, which is strictly better than settling
  // EV-negative on the positively-correlated ones we've been mispricing.
  //
  // sgpCorrelationNegative is no longer consulted but kept in config
  // for potential future use (e.g., restoring direction logic once
  // per-sport/per-spread-magnitude rules are calibrated).
  //
  // Only applies to 2-leg spread_total SGPs — the only combo currently
  // in SGP_ALLOWED_COMBOS. ml_total was briefly added + reverted on
  // 2026-04-22 (operator concern that ml_total correlation is stronger
  // than our flat 1.08 factor captures — would risk EV leak until we
  // add per-combo tuning). If ml_total is re-enabled later, extend the

  // number still goes to PX). Gate in template-ramp + longshot-add is
  // passed through so v2 sees the same exposure context as v1.
  //
  // When pricingV2Live is also true, OVERRIDE the v1 americanOdds with
  // v2's computed value. Ships code-dark until Mike flips the flag.
  //
  // Hot-path cost: the v2 pipeline (calibration + correlation +
  // ev-vig) adds ~500-1000µs per quote. That cost is unavoidable when
  // pricingV2Live is true (we need v2's price before returning), but
  // when it's false (pure shadow) we can defer with setImmediate so
  // the offer returns to the WS handler first and v2 computes on the
  // next event loop tick. Observed regression 2026-04-24: p50 went
  // from <1.0ms to ~1.6ms once v2 shadow went wide. This defer path
  // recovers that — the shadow log still populates, just milliseconds
  // later, and nothing downstream reads meta._v2Shadow today.

  // SAME-PLAYER RULE rationale: two prop legs on the same player are
  // correlated regardless of which stats are measured. Even combos that

  // deep" factor that inflates BOTH probabilities together. Without
  // measured per-(sport, prop_a, prop_b) correlation factors, we can't
  // safely de-vig the joint probability — declining is the asymmetric-
  // risk-correct call (overestimating correlation just declines a
  // profitable RFQ; underestimating sells the bettor a parlay too
  // cheaply).
