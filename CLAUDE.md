# ProphetX Parlay Service Provider

Automated market maker for parlay bets on ProphetX (PX). Receives RFQs via WebSocket, prices them using de-vigged sportsbook odds, and submits offers back.

## User Context

- **Timezone**: US Eastern (ET)
- **Operator**: Mike — runs the parlay SP, monitors via dashboard

## Architecture

```
index.js                  Entry point — Express server + async startup sequence
config.js                 Env vars, pricing defaults, sport mappings
services/
  prophetx.js             PX API client (auth, events, markets, offers, confirmations)
  websocket.js            Pusher WebSocket — RFQ/confirm/settle event handlers
  pricer.js               Pricing engine — fair value + vig → offer (American odds)
  odds-feed.js            SharpAPI (primary) + The Odds API (fallback) — de-vigged odds
  line-manager.js         Maps PX line_ids to Odds API events, team name matching
  order-tracker.js        Exposure tracking, P&L, market intelligence, decline stats
  db.js                   Supabase client (parlay_orders, matched_parlays tables)
  logger.js               Simple leveled logger (debug/info/warn/error)
client/
  index.html              Dashboard SPA (Live, Analytics, History, Market Intel, Config tabs)
```

## Deployment

- **Platform**: Railway (auto-deploys on push to main)
- **Runtime**: Node.js (`npm start` → `node index.js`)
- **Dev**: `npm run dev` → `node --watch index.js`
- **No build step** — vanilla JS, no TypeScript, no bundler

## Auth & Read-Only Viewers

Three roles via HTTP Basic Auth (browser-native login dialog):

- **Admin** (`AUTH_USERNAME` / `AUTH_PASSWORD`) — full access to `/` (main dashboard), all admin endpoints, and `/viewer`.
- **Full viewer** (`AUTH_FULL_VIEWERS`) — read-only access to the **full** dashboard (`/`, market intel, lines, reports, all GET endpoints). Every POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH returns 403. Admin-action buttons (Pause, Refresh Lines, etc.) remain visible but silently fail when clicked.
- **Viewer** (`AUTH_VIEWERS`) — read-only, restricted to `AUTH_VIEWER_PATHS`. Default list scopes them to the scaled-down `/viewer` dashboard plus the two endpoints it polls (`/status`, `/orders`) and `/me`.

**Provisioning:**
- Scaled-down viewer: `AUTH_VIEWERS=alice:correctHorse,bob:battery` — point them at `https://<host>/viewer`.
- Full read-only viewer: `AUTH_FULL_VIEWERS=charlie:correctHorse2,dave:battery2` — point them at `https://<host>/`.

If a username appears in both lists, `AUTH_VIEWERS` wins (more restrictive); a warning logs at boot. Don't reuse usernames between the admin slot and the viewer pools either — collisions are skipped with a warning.

**Sign-out:** HTTP Basic Auth credentials are cached by the browser until the tab/process closes. There is no clean server-side logout.

## RFQ Flow

1. **Startup**: Auth with PX → fetch odds → seed lines (match PX events to Odds API) → connect WebSocket → register supported lines
2. **price.ask.new** (broadcast): RFQ arrives → `shouldDecline()` checks legs known + correlation + exposure → `priceParlay()` gets fair probs, applies vig → `submitOffer()` sends American odds back via callback URL
3. **price.confirm.new** (private): PX asks to confirm → re-validate pricing (5% drift check) → accept/reject
4. **order.matched** (broadcast): Any SP's parlay gets filled — tracked for market intelligence
5. **order.settled** / **parlay.settled** (private): Settlement → P&L recording

## Pricing Logic

- **De-vig**: For each leg, average fair probabilities across sportsbooks using `deVig2Way()` (proportional removal)
- **Parlay fair prob**: Product of individual leg fair probs
- **Offered prob**: `fairParlayProb * (1 + vig)` (makes price worse for bettor)
- **Odds format**: PX uses American odds throughout. `decimalToAmerican()` in pricer.js handles conversion
- **Alt lines**: If RFQ has a spread/total not matching the primary line, fetches alt lines from The Odds API on demand (Pinnacle)
- **Stale check**: Declines if odds cache is older than `stalePriceMinutes`
- **Started check**: Declines if event has already started

## Correlation Rules (pricer.js `shouldDecline`)

- **Blocked**: Spread + moneyline on same game (highly correlated)
- **Blocked**: Two of same market type on same game
- **Allowed**: Spread/moneyline + total on same game

## Odds Sources

- **SharpAPI** (`api.sharpapi.io`): Primary source for NBA, MLB, NHL, tennis, soccer. Free tier covers DraftKings + FanDuel
- **The Odds API** (`api.the-odds-api.com`): Fallback for NCAAB. Also used on-demand for alternate spread/total lines (Pinnacle, DK, FD)
- **DK World Cup props scraper** (`scripts/dk-wc-props.js`): NEITHER API above carries
  DraftKings for soccer player props (shots/SoT/goalscorer/assists — BetRivers/FanDuel only,
  and they diverge badly from DK). This scraper pulls them straight off the DK site:
  `node scripts/dk-wc-props.js <away>-vs-<home>/<eventId> [outFile]` → JSON
  `{goalscorer:[{player,seo,odds}], sot:[{player,seo,one,two}], assists:[{player,seo,odds}]}`.
  Find event slugs/ids with `scripts/_dk_find_events.js` (lists `/event/...` links from DK's
  `world-cup-2026` league page). How it works: DK's JSON API is Akamai-gated (403 to vanilla
  clients) and CORS-locked, so headless Puppeteer loads the event page to pass the JS
  challenge, then passively intercepts the `eventSubcategory/v1/markets` XHRs the SPA fires;
  prop tabs lazy-load, so it clicks each subcategory `<h2>` by exact title (clicking the
  container div does nothing). Subcategory ids (per-league, may rotate — re-recon if a market
  comes back empty): goalscorer 16604, SoT 16861, shots 16868, assists 16863. Odds are
  American strings normalized to ASCII (DK serves U+2212 minus); `seo` carries the accented
  real name (e.g. "Vinícius Júnior") — use it for name-matching to PX. Ground-truth validated
  2026-06-11: 254/256 exact vs hand-typed DK boards (the 2 diffs were live line movement).
  Used by the WC NO-posting routine (anytime goalscorer / 1+ & 2+ SoT / 1+ assists mirrors).

## Team Name Matching (line-manager.js)

PX and odds APIs use different team names. Matching strategies (in order):
1. Override map (`TEAM_NAME_OVERRIDES` — NHL abbreviations like WAS, CBJ, MTL)
2. Exact normalized match
3. Substring containment
4. Last N words match (e.g., "Red Sox" matches "Boston Red Sox")

## API Endpoints (Express)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | Railway health check (always 200) |
| `/status` | GET | Full service status JSON |
| `/orders` | GET | Recent orders with P&L |
| `/market-intel` | GET | All matched parlays across SPs |
| `/refresh-odds` | POST | Manual odds refresh |
| `/refresh-lines` | POST | Manual line re-seed |
| `/pause` | POST | Stop responding to RFQs |
| `/resume` | POST | Resume RFQ handling |
| `/reconnect` | POST | Force WebSocket reconnect |
| `/odds-events` | GET | Debug: cached odds events |
| `/lines` | GET | Debug: registered line index |

## Database (Supabase)

- **parlay_orders**: Our quotes, confirmations, settlements, P&L
- **matched_parlays**: All matched parlays across all SPs (market intelligence)
- Upserts on `parlay_id` for orders

## Key Gotchas

- **American odds, not decimal**: PX rejects decimal odds with "invalid odds" 400. All odds submitted must be American integers (e.g., +150, -200). Fixed in commit 10c1469.
- **config import order**: Services that use `config` must import at top of file, not lazily. The "key is not defined" bug was caused by config imported at bottom of websocket.js. Fixed in commit 10c1469.
- **valid_until is nanoseconds**: PX expects `valid_until` in nanoseconds, not milliseconds or seconds.
- **callback_url is absolute**: `submitOffer` and `confirmOrder` use the callback URL from the RFQ directly (not relative to baseUrl).
- **Both channels are private-prefixed**: PX WebSocket channels are both `private-*` — the broadcast one has "broadcast" in the name.
- **Back-to-back/doubleheader matching**: Odds cache stores arrays per team pair, matched by closest `commenceTime` to handle same-day series.
- **Full-game only**: Line manager filters out first half, quarter, period, inning, player props — only registers full-game moneyline/spread/total.
- **max_risk enforcement**: PX sandbox may not enforce max_risk limits. A $2,447 order was confirmed despite max_risk=500. Open question for Alec (PX contact).

## Conventions

- CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`), no ES modules
- No TypeScript, no build step
- `node-fetch@2` (CommonJS compatible)
- Logging: `log.info('Category', 'message', optionalData)`
- **NEVER `git push` without explicit user approval.** Push auto-deploys to Railway production. Commit freely, but the push must always be gated on the user typing "push" (or equivalent) in chat. Do NOT push after completing work, do NOT push as part of a batched command, do NOT assume earlier approval carries over to a new commit. Every single push requires a fresh green-light.
